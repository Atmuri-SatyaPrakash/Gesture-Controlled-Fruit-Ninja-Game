Bring Fruit Ninja to life — no keyboard or mouse needed! This fun mini-project lets you slice falling fruits with real-time hand gestures using your webcam. Built using OpenCV and MediaPipe, the game detects your hand movements and turns them into slicing actions. Perfect for showcasing interactive computer vision!

**🎮 Game Features**
✋ Real-time hand tracking with MediaPipe.

**Randomly falling fruits :** slice them before they fall off the screen.

**Gesture slicing:** Swipe quickly over fruits with your index finger to slice them.

**Missed fruits counter:** Miss 3 and it's game over.

**Swipe detection logic:** Only fast hand swipes count — not just touching.

**Live HUD:** Displays your score and how many fruits you’ve missed.

**Game Over screen:** Shows when you miss 3 fruits.

**Restart or Exit:** After game over, press R to restart or Q to quit.

Smaller fruits for a more challenging experience.

**🛠 Troubleshooting**

1. Webcam not working?

Make sure no other app is using the camera.

2. **Try changing the camera index:**

Replace cv2.VideoCapture(0) with cv2.VideoCapture(1) in the code.

3. **Hand not detected?**

Ensure good lighting.

Keep your hand clearly visible in the frame.

4. **Laggy or low FPS?**

Reduce webcam resolution in the code for smoother performance.
